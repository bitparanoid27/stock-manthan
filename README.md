This is the codified version of Stock Manthan process as highlighted in the book Stock Manthan - The hunt for Multibagger stocks [ https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55591522-stock-manthan ]. 
In the book process was applied for the Indian stock, but I've used to same process to sift and find out multi-bagger stocks in the US stocks. 

The process is quite simple it basically filtering stocks on certains criteria as listed below: 
For a stock to clear initial screening it must satisfy the below criteria.
  - Sales / revenue growth for last 3 years >= 8%
  - Profit growth for last 3 year >= 10%
  - Minimum return on investment for last 3 years >= 15%
  - Average return on investment for last 5 years >= 14%
  - Minimum return on capital employed for last 3 years >= 15%
  - Minimum return on capital employed for last 5 years >= 14%
  - Maximum debt to equity ratio = 1.0
  - Stock price appreciation in last 3 years >= 30%

This ensures we're only selecting stocks where sales are increasing, shareholders funds are appreciating, capital employed is working in favour of earning returns for shareholders, and debt is under-control. So it eliminates companies which using debt to growth more than the acceptable limit. 

For the valuation phase the above selected stock(s) must satisfy the below mentioned criteria:
- Cashflow to operations / Profit after tax ratio should be >= 75%
- Firm's tax slab should be in the acceptable range ( 18% to 36% )
- Equity multiplier should be < 4
- Peg ratio i.e. P/E ratio / growth should be < 2
- CVC ratio co-efficient of valuation < 2. It's stock 5 years (60 months) of average p/e divided by (60 months) stock price. It helps us understand whether the stock is being fairly priced. Ideal cvc ratio should be around 1.
