This is the codified version of Stock Manthan process as highlighted in the book Stock Manthan - The hunt for Multibagger stocks [ https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55591522-stock-manthan ]. 
In the book process was applied for the Indian stock, but I've used to same process to sift and find out multi-bagger stocks in the US stocks. 

The process is quite simple it basically filtering stocks on certains criteria as listed below: 
  - For a stock to clear initial screening it must satisfy the below criteria.
  - Sales / revenue growth for last 3 years > 8%
  - Profit growth for last 3 year > 10%
  - Minimum return on investment for last 3 years > 15%
