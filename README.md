This is the codified version of Stock Manthan process as highlighted in the book Stock Manthan - The hunt for Multibagger stocks [ https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55591522-stock-manthan ]. 
In the book process was applied for the Indian stock, but I've used to same process to sift and find out multi-bagger stocks in the US stocks.
